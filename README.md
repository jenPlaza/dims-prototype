# Dreams In Motion Studio(DIMS)

Dreams In Motion Studio (DIMS) is a fully responsive HTML prototype developed using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. Designed and built from scratch, the DIMS project adopts a development methodology similar to that of the AYPAD project. However, DIMS stands apart with its unique dual-role focus, emphasizing the parent-child company relationship that underpins the AYPAD initiative.

To establish and reinforce this parent-child dynamic between companies, I implemented a standardized header featuring the AYPAD navigation menu, as well as a universal footer containing AYPAD footer details. One of the menu items is a brand section that showcases the logos and links for four affiliated companies. Ideally, all four companies would incorporate both of these shared components; however, DIMS serves as the first completed example. Within the website layout, the AYPAD header appears first, followed by the DIMS Studio header, which is prominently displayed in the top quarter of the page. Toward the bottom, just above the parent footer, users will find the DIMS footer.

AYPAD has expanded into four distinct subprojects, two of which I was responsible for designing and developing entirely from concept to completion. This involved creating high-fidelity wireframes and style guides before progressing to the development phase. Each website has been thoroughly optimized for full responsiveness, ensuring smooth functionality across mobile and desktop platforms. Additionally, key features such as schemas, service-worker.js files, favicon icons, and site.webmanifest files have been integrated to improve SEO performance.
