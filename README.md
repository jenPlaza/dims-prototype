# Dreams In Motion Studio(DIMS)

**An Africa Youth for Peace and Development(AYPAD) initiative Volunteer project<br />Contact: Jim Tamuro & Philip Salis Bangura**

Dreams In Motion Studio (DIMS) represents a fully responsive HTML prototype crafted using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. Conceptualized and developed from the ground up, the DIMS initiative adopts a development approach similar to that employed in the AYPAD project. However, what distinguishes this initiative is its dual-role focus, reflecting the parent-child company relationship central to the work on AYPAD. AYPAD has diversified into four distinct subprojects, two of which I had the privilege of designing and developing entirely from conception. This process began with the creation of high-fidelity wireframes and style guides, followed by development stages. Each of these websites has been optimized for full responsiveness, ensuring seamless functionality across both mobile and desktop platforms. Furthermore, these projects incorporate key features such as schemas, service-worker.js, favicon icons, and site.webmanifest files, all contributing to enhanced SEO performance.

## About AYPAD

Africa Youth for Peace and Development (AYPAD), founded on 24 October 1995 in Sierra Leone and registered as a non-profit in 2000, holds accreditation with the UN Economic and Social Council. Created by seven young men impacted by war and violence in Africa, AYPAD aims to promote peace and development for African youth.

The organization focuses on empowering disadvantaged and marginalized youth through initiatives supporting peace, sustainable growth, and social inclusion. Fully reliant on charitable funding, AYPAD targets vulnerable young people across Africa.

With affiliations to networks like GYAN, GYCA, and Peace Child International, and registration in 29 African countries, AYPAD operates under its belief that violence solves nothing, striving to secure a peaceful future for the continent.
